Feature: Recommending a provider
  As a customer of a provider
  I want to be able to submit a recommendation for a company
  So that I can show my appreciation
  
  As an EY admin
  I want customers to submit their details (name, company, email, url) before submitting a recommendation
  So that the system will be at least partially protected from gaming
  
  As a provider
  I want to approve a recommendation before it appears on the site
  So that I don't get spammed
